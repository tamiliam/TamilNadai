    <div class="leaf-card p-6 mb-6">
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-etch mb-3">Our Mission</h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-etch-light leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Tamil Nadai is an open platform for documenting, discussing, and validating Tamil writing conventions. Our primary goal is to build a <strong>gold-standard evaluation dataset</strong> for testing how well Large Language Models (LLMs) handle Tamil writing &mdash; grounded in established standards and validated through scholarly collaboration.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-etch-light leading-relaxed">
            The name <span class="tamil-serif font-semibold">தமிழ் நடை</span> (Tamil Nadai) means "Tamil style" or "Tamil usage" &mdash; it refers to the accepted conventions of written Tamil, as distinct from grammar rules alone. Getting the நடை right is what makes Tamil text look and feel natural to a reader.
        </p>

    <!-- The Problem -->
    <div class="leaf-card p-6 mb-6">
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-etch mb-3">Why This Matters</h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-etch-light leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Tamil currently has only <strong>65 sentences</strong> in the IndicGEC benchmark &mdash; the most widely used grammar evaluation dataset for Indian languages. For a language with over 80 million speakers, this is wholly inadequate. LLMs like GPT, Gemini, and Claude consistently fail on exactly the prescriptive conventions our rules test &mdash; sandhi doubling, word joining, <span class="tamil">ஒரு</span> vs <span class="tamil">ஓர்</span> usage &mdash; yet there is no rigorous way to measure or compare their performance.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-etch-light leading-relaxed mb-3">
            Tamil Nadai aims to produce <strong>~500 expert-annotated sentence pairs</strong> (erroneous and corrected), each traced to a specific rule and page in an authoritative publication, organised into a 12-category error taxonomy. This dataset will be:
        </p>
        <ul class="space-y-1 text-sm text-etch-light list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Published on HuggingFace for open access</li>
            <li>The <strong>largest prescriptive Tamil grammar evaluation set</strong> in existence</li>
            <li>Immediately usable to benchmark any LLM or NLP model on Tamil</li>
            <li>A foundation for grammar checking tools, NLP training data, and teaching materials</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-sm text-etch-light leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Tamil Nadai builds on two foundations. The first is the
            <span class="tamil-serif font-semibold">தமிழ் நடைக் கையேடு</span> (Tamil Writing Style Guide)
            published by the <strong>Tamil Virtual University</strong>
            (<a href="https://tamilvu.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-stylus hover:text-stylus-dark underline">tamilvu.org</a>),
            an institution of the Government of Tamil Nadu &mdash; the most authoritative contemporary reference for Tamil writing conventions.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-etch-light leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The second is a decade of work encoding these conventions into 85+ machine-readable grammar rules for
            <a href="https://languagetool.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-stylus hover:text-stylus-dark underline">LanguageTool</a>,
            an open-source proofreading tool &mdash; the first systematic attempt to make Tamil writing conventions testable by software.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-etch-light leading-relaxed">
            The rules are organised into three categories:
        </p>
        <ul class="mt-2 space-y-1 text-sm text-etch-light list-disc list-inside">
            <li><strong class="tamil">இலக்கண அமைப்பில் சொற்கள்</strong> &mdash; Word joining based on grammatical structure</li>
            <li><strong class="tamil">தனிச் சொற்களை எழுதும் முறை</strong> &mdash; Conventions for writing individual words</li>
            <li><strong class="tamil">சந்தி</strong> &mdash; Sandhi (euphonic combination rules)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- How It Works -->
    <div class="leaf-card p-6 mb-6">
        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-etch mb-3">How It Works</h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-etch-light leading-relaxed mb-3">
            Each rule in the workbench is paired with example sentences &mdash; both correct and incorrect usages. These sentences go through a collaborative review process:
        </p>
        <ol class="space-y-2 text-sm text-etch-light list-decimal list-inside">
            <li>A contributor adds an example sentence (manually or with AI assistance)</li>
            <li>Two independent reviewers evaluate the sentence</li>
            <li>If both reviewers accept it, the sentence is permanently recorded</li>
            <li>If either reviewer rejects it, the sentence is marked for revision</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="text-sm text-etch-light leading-relaxed mt-3">
            This two-reviewer system ensures quality and consensus before any sentence becomes part of the reference collection.

        <p class="text-sm text-etch-light leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Tamil Nadai is being developed as a collaborative research tool in partnership with the
            <strong>Department of Malaysian Languages and Applied Linguistics</strong> at the
            <strong>Faculty of Languages and Linguistics, Universiti Malaya</strong>
            (<a href="https://fll.um.edu.my/jbmlt-introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-stylus hover:text-stylus-dark underline">fll.um.edu.my</a>).
            The department offers one of Malaysia's only Bachelor programmes in Tamil Language and Linguistics.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-etch-light leading-relaxed">
            We welcome collaboration from other universities and language institutions. If your department works on Tamil linguistics, corpus development, or computational approaches to Tamil, we would be glad to have you involved.

            This project builds on over a decade of work in Tamil language technology. The original effort began in 2014 with the creation of 85+ grammar checking rules for
            <a href="https://languagetool.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-stylus hover:text-stylus-dark underline">LanguageTool</a>,
            an open-source proofreading tool. Those rules were the first systematic attempt to encode Tamil writing conventions into software that could check text automatically.

        <p class="text-sm text-etch-light leading-relaxed">
            The same contributor led Tamil localisation efforts for Mozilla Firefox, OpenOffice, and LibreOffice &mdash; making these tools accessible to millions of Tamil speakers. Tamil Nadai is the next step: building a validated, peer-reviewed corpus of Tamil writing conventions that can power the next generation of Tamil language tools.
